# 2dots1line V7 Implementation Log

## Introduction

This document serves as the historical implementation log for 2dots1line tasks completed during the V4 development phase (through task 2.3). It records the implementations, decisions, and outcomes of each completed development step as a reference for future work.

The actual implementation roadmap for V7 has been moved to a separate document (V7ExecutionRoadmap.md), which continues from this foundation and introduces the new V7 architecture.

## Task 1: Monorepo & Core Infrastructure Setup

### Task 1.1: Initialize Monorepo Structure (COMPLETED)

**Date Completed**: March 15, 2025

**Implementation Summary**:
- Created base directory structure using Turborepo
- Set up package.json configurations with correct dependencies
- Implemented ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Added TypeScript configuration for the monorepo
- Created initial README and documentation

**Key Decisions**:
- Selected Turborepo over Nx for simpler configuration and better npm workspace integration
- Used Node.js 18 as the minimum engine version for all packages
- Implemented strict TypeScript configuration across the monorepo
- Opted for a structure that separates apps, packages, services, and workers

**Issues Encountered**:
- Initial conflicts between ESLint and Prettier rules (resolved by using eslint-config-prettier)
- Some confusion around Turborepo caching configuration (resolved by consulting documentation)
- Needed to explicitly configure TypeScript module resolution strategy

**Verification**:
- Successfully ran `npm run build` across all packages
- ESLint and Prettier formatting works correctly
- Turborepo caching functions as expected between builds

### Task 1.2: Set Up Database Package (COMPLETED)

**Date Completed**: March 18, 2025

**Implementation Summary**:
- Created `packages/database` package
- Implemented Prisma client wrapper for PostgreSQL
- Added Neo4j client wrapper
- Implemented Weaviate client wrapper for vector operations
- Added Redis client wrapper for caching
- Created connection pooling and environment configuration
- Added initial schema and types for core entities

**Key Decisions**:
- Used Prisma for PostgreSQL access for type safety and migration management
- Implemented connection pooling for Neo4j to improve performance
- Created custom wrapper around Weaviate client to simplify vector operations
- Used IORedis for Redis client for better TypeScript support

**Issues Encountered**:
- Neo4j session management required careful handling to prevent leaks
- Weaviate schema management needed special handling for vector configuration
- Redis connection needed proper error handling and reconnection logic

**Verification**:
- Successfully connected to all databases in local environment
- Ran sample queries to validate each client implementation
- Verified connection pooling functions correctly under load
- Confirmed proper error handling for connection failures

### Task 1.3: Implement Shared Types Package (COMPLETED)

**Date Completed**: March 20, 2025

**Implementation Summary**:
- Created `packages/shared-types` package
- Defined core entity interfaces (User, Memory, Concept, etc.)
- Added API request/response types
- Implemented utility types for common patterns
- Created schema validation using Zod
- Added documentation for type usage

**Key Decisions**:
- Used TypeScript interfaces for entities rather than classes
- Implemented Zod schema for runtime validation
- Created separate namespace for API types
- Used branded types for IDs to improve type safety

**Issues Encountered**:
- Some circular type references needed careful restructuring
- Balancing between too generic and too specific types
- Ensuring consistency with database schema representations

**Verification**:
- Imported types successfully in other packages
- Used Zod validators with test data
- Confirmed type compatibility with expected API formats

## Task 2: Cognitive Agents Foundation

### Task 2.1: Implement Tool Registry (COMPLETED - V4)

**Note**: This task was completed as part of V4. V7 will build upon this.

### Task 2.2: Update Dialogue Agent & Integrate Orb System Prompt (In Progress)

**Date Started**: May 21, 2025
**Date Updated**: May 21, 2025

**Implementation Summary (So Far)**:
- **Orb System Prompt Integrated**: 
  - Created a new file `services/dialogue-agent/src/prompts/orb.system.prompt.md` and populated it with the "Orb System Prompt (Gemini API)" from the global `docs/OrbSystemPrompt.md`.
  - Refactored `services/dialogue-agent/src/prompts/SystemPromptManager.ts`:
    - The constructor now loads the Orb system prompt from `orb.system.prompt.md`.
    - The `generateSystemPrompt` method now primarily returns this comprehensive, static Orb prompt, removing the previous dynamic prompt generation logic for the "Dot" persona.

**Key Decisions**:
- Stored the comprehensive Orb system prompt in its own Markdown file within the Dialogue Agent's `prompts` directory for clarity and maintainability.
- Simplified `SystemPromptManager` to serve this static prompt, as the Orb prompt itself is designed to be quite complete and context-aware.

**Issues Encountered**:
- None during this specific sub-task.

**Fixes Applied**:
- N/A

**Lessons Learned**:
- Centralizing detailed persona prompts in dedicated files makes them easier to manage and update than embedding them as long strings in code or general JSON configuration files.

**Next Steps for Task 2.2**:
- Refactor the core Dialogue Agent logic (`services/dialogue-agent/src/agent/`) to ensure it correctly initializes and uses the updated `SystemPromptManager`.
- Verify that the LLM calls are made with the new Orb system prompt.
- Begin refactoring the Dialogue Agent to align its interaction patterns and tool usage with the new event-sourcing model and Orb's capabilities as defined in its system prompt.
- Address other aspects of Task 1.2 from `V7ExecutionRoadmap.md` (this seems to be a typo in the log and should refer to Task 2.2 of the roadmap, specifically updating Cognitive Agents for event sourcing).

### Task 2.3: Create Web App Shell (COMPLETED)

**Date Completed**: April 10, 2025

**Implementation Summary**:
- Created `apps/web-app` using Next.js
- Implemented base application structure
- Set up routing and layouts
- Added initial authentication flow
- Implemented API routes for backend communication
- Created placeholder UI components
- Set up initial styling with Tailwind CSS
- Added Three.js and React Three Fiber setup

**Key Decisions**:
- Used Next.js App Router for improved server components
- Implemented a basic authentication system with NextAuth
- Created a responsive layout system for different devices
- Added initial Three.js setup for future 3D implementation

**Issues Encountered**:
- Some challenges with Next.js App Router data fetching
- Three.js integration required careful setup for SSR
- Managing state between server and client components
- Setting up proper TypeScript types for Next.js components

**Verification**:
- Successfully loaded the application in development
- Navigation between routes works correctly
- Authentication flow functions as expected
- Three.js canvas renders correctly
- Responsive layout works on different screen sizes

## Prerequisite Task: Dockerized PostgreSQL Setup & Docker Compose Refinement

**Date Completed**: May 21, 2025

**Implementation Summary**:
- **PostgreSQL Docker Service**: Added a PostgreSQL service to the `docker-compose.yml` file. This configuration includes:
  - Image: `postgres:15`
  - Container Name: `postgres-2d1l`
  - Port Mapping: `5433:5432` (initially `5432:5432`, then changed to `5433:5432` due to host port conflict)
  - Environment Variables: `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB` (user updated these to custom values).
  - Volume: `./postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data` for persistent storage.
  - Network: Attached to `2d1l_network`.
- **Environment Configuration**: Updated the `.env` file to set `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5433/twodots1line` (user to replace placeholders with actual credentials).
- **Docker Compose Refinements**:
  - Removed the obsolete `version: '3.8'` attribute.
  - Changed `networks: { 2d1l_network: {} }` to `networks: { 2d1l_network: { external: true } }` at the top level, and ensured all services use this external network.
- **Port Conflict Resolution**:
  - Identified that port `5433` (and initially `5432`) was in use by a local PostgreSQL instance.
  - Stopped the conflicting service using `brew services stop postgresql`.
  - When the port was still in use, identified the PID using `sudo lsof -i :5433`.
  - Terminated the process using `sudo kill <PID>`.
- **Verification**:
  - Successfully started all Docker containers (`neo4j-2d1l`, `weaviate-2d1l`, `postgres-2d1l`) using `docker-compose up -d --build`.

**Key Decisions**:
- Used Docker for containerized PostgreSQL deployment for consistency across environments.
- Mapped host port `5433` to container port `5432` for PostgreSQL to avoid common conflicts with default local instances.
- Configured persistent storage for PostgreSQL using a Docker volume.
- Ensured all services use a common, externally defined Docker network (`2d1l_network`).

**Issues Encountered**:
- **Port Conflicts**: Host port `5432` (and subsequently `5433`) was already in use by a local PostgreSQL instance.
- **Obsolete Docker Compose Version**: The `version` attribute in `docker-compose.yml` was outdated.
- **Network Configuration**: The Docker network was initially defined inline, which can sometimes lead to issues; switched to an external network definition.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Changed PostgreSQL port mapping in `docker-compose.yml`.
- Stopped and killed conflicting local PostgreSQL processes.
- Removed `version` attribute from `docker-compose.yml`.
- Updated network configuration in `docker-compose.yml`.

**Lessons Learned**:
- Always check for port conflicts before starting new services. `lsof -i :<port>` is a valuable tool.
- Keep Docker Compose configurations up-to-date with current best practices (e.g., external network definitions).
- Stopping a service via `brew services` might not always immediately free up the port if the underlying process doesn't terminate cleanly.

## Task 1: Monorepo & Core Infrastructure Setup

### Task 1.1: Implement Event-Sourcing Schema Updates (Partially Completed)

**Date Started**: May 21, 2025
**Date Updated**: May 21, 2025

**Implementation Summary (So Far)**:
- **Prisma Schema Updated**: 
  - Modified the existing `growth_events` model in `apps/backend-api/prisma/schema.prisma` to align with `V7DataSchemaDesign.md`. The updated model includes `event_id`, `user_id`, `entity_id`, `entity_type`, `dim_key`, `delta`, `source`, and `created_at`.
  - Added the `growth_profile` JSONB field to the `users` model (it was already present but confirmed relevant).
  - Added SQL definitions for `mv_entity_growth` (materialized view) and `v_card_state` (view) as comments in `schema.prisma` for clarity. These view definitions are intended to be created and managed via raw SQL in migrations.
- **Database Migration Created & Applied**:
  - Generated a new Prisma migration named `v7_event_sourcing_schema` using `npx prisma migrate dev --name v7_event_sourcing_schema --create-only`.
  - Manually appended the SQL for `mv_entity_growth` and `v_card_state` to the generated `migration.sql` file.
  - Successfully applied the migration to the PostgreSQL database using `npx prisma migrate dev`.
- **Database Helper Functions Implemented**:
  - Added `createGrowthEvent(data: Omit<Prisma.growth_eventsCreateInput, 'user'> & { userId: string })` to `packages/database/src/prisma/index.ts` for inserting new growth events.
  - Added `getGrowthProfile(userId: string)` to fetch the `growth_profile` from the `users` table.
  - Added `getCardState(entityId: string, userId: string)` to query the `v_card_state` view (note: this currently queries `concepts` directly and will need updating if `v_card_state` is the intended target and can support parameters, or if a different approach for card state is taken).

**Key Decisions**:
- Managed view definitions (`mv_entity_growth`, `v_card_state`) via raw SQL in migrations rather than attempting to model them directly in Prisma schema, which is standard practice for complex views or materialized views.
- Created specific helper functions in the `packages/database` Prisma service to encapsulate interactions with the new event-sourcing tables and views.

**Issues Encountered**:
- **`DATABASE_URL` not found**: Initial attempts to run `prisma migrate dev` failed because the command was run from the wrong directory or the `.env` file was not loaded. Resolved by running from the monorepo root and ensuring `.env` is accessible.
- **Migration history conflict**: Prisma detected a mismatch with a previous V4 migration (`20250517023631_init_v4_schema`). Resolved by deleting the V4 migration folder (as V7 is a fresh start for this schema aspect).
- **SQL Error in View Definition**: The `v_card_state` view definition initially had an error (`column "entity_id" does not exist`) due to incorrect aliasing/grouping in a subquery. Corrected the SQL in `migration.sql`.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Ensured Prisma commands are run from the workspace root.
- Deleted the conflicting V4 migration directory `apps/backend-api/prisma/migrations/20250517023631_init_v4_schema/`.
  - Corrected the SQL in `migration.sql` for the `v_card_state` view (changed `GROUP BY entity_id` to `GROUP BY cr.source_concept_id` and selected `cr.source_concept_id AS entity_id`).
- Applied the corrected migration successfully.

**Lessons Learned**:
- Prisma migrations require careful management, especially when transitioning between major schema versions or when old migrations are no longer relevant.
- Raw SQL for views and complex queries should be thoroughly tested before being included in migrations.
- Running CLI tools that depend on environment variables (like `DATABASE_URL`) from the correct directory or ensuring the environment is properly sourced is crucial.

**Next Steps for Task 1.1**:
- **Testing**: Write unit/integration tests for the new helper functions (`createGrowthEvent`, `getGrowthProfile`, `getCardState`).
- **Refine `getCardState`**: Clarify if `getCardState` should query the `v_card_state` view directly (and how to pass parameters to it if it's a view that doesn't naturally take them) or if it needs a more complex query. The current implementation queries the `concepts` table.
- **Seeding**: Develop seed scripts for `growth_events` for testing and development.
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling in the new database helper functions.
- **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments to the new helper functions in `packages/database/src/prisma/index.ts`. (Already partially done)
