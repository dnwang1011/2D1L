Overall verdict

The V-7 monorepo layout is sound — it cleanly mirrors the 3-layer UI architecture, keeps cognitive agents in their own services/* area, and uses Turbo repo for incremental builds.
Below are a handful of tactical tweaks and strategic guard-rails you may want to add before code starts to ossify.

⸻

1. Clarify the “vertical vs. horizontal” rule

Current state
	•	Front-end “vertical slices” live inside apps/web-app (canvas/, orb/, components/ …).
	•	Shared “horizontal” libraries live in packages/*.

Risk – The orb, card, and canvas teams will inevitably introduce duplicate util or state code.

Suggestion

What to change	How
Move scene-agnostic camera, controls, post-processing out of apps/web-app/canvas/ into packages/canvas-core (only keep scene-specific code inside the app).	Prevents shader utils and perf helpers from being copied into the mobile folder later.
Rename packages/utils  packages/core-utils and explicitly forbid importing it inside other “shared” packages (use a barrel export instead).	Forces a single dependency direction and avoids circular builds.

2. Split deployment from infrastructure IaC

Keeping both AWS and Tencent Terraform in the same infrastructure/ tree is handy for diffing, but mixing provider state files in one repo usually ends up with terraform apply accidents.

Change:

infrastructure/
├── modules/        # reusable building blocks
├── env-aws/        # region-specific root configs
└── env-tencent/



Add a simple GH action that blocks a PR if a .tf file is edited outside its env folder without bumping both roots.

3. Introduce an API gateway (BFF) early

Right now each service publishes its own REST routes (backend-api/chat, card.controller.ts, etc.).
Before mobile/desktop native teams appear, drop a lightweight GraphQL or tRPC gateway under apps/api-gateway/:

/apps
  └── api-gateway/   # calls services via gRPC / HTTP, centralizes auth

Benefit: you swap internal service boundaries later without versioning headaches on the web/mobile clients.

4. “3D assets” pipeline: keep source of truth binary-free

Binary GLBs, HDRIs, and textures bloat the repo even with Git LFS.

Keep in Git	Store elsewhere
Low-poly source .blend / .glb under 5 MB	Optimised, packed, or compressed artifacts

Hook the scripts/asset-processing/* tools to pull from an object-store bucket during CI so dev machines stay lean.

⸻

5. Agents: migrate to one process per agent only if needed

Each agent currently sits in services/* and is likely a Node worker. Unless you really need inter-agent network hops, start with a single “cognitive-services” process exporting adapters:

services/
  cognitive-hub/
    src/
      agents/
      tools/
      ...

Split into micro-services once traffic patterns prove it’s worth it; saves infra and latency early on.

6. Dev-experience polish

Item	Tweaks
Shader lint	Add glslify and glsl-type-basics in CI; catch precision or WebGL 1 fallbacks.
Storybook	Move to its own apps/storybook/ so CI can cache built stories separately from Next build.
Turborepo cache key	Add .node-version and turbo.json to globalDependencies so Node upgrade triggers full rebuild correctly.


⸻

7. Package naming convention

Use @2dots1line/<scope>-<name> consistently.
Examples:
	•	@2dots1line/ui-button
	•	@2dots1line/canvas-core
	•	@2dots1line/agent-dialogue

Easier for external tooling (e.g., Storybook autoload, size-limit checks).

⸻

8. Test strategy quick-wins
	•	Add Cypress Component Testing inside apps/web-app for shader-free UI pieces.
	•	Use Playwright + WebGL context stub for 3D scenes (renders once on headless GPU runner).
	•	Snapshot test Orb GLB scene JSON rather than full canvas screenshots to keep diffs minimal.

⸻

TL;DR

Gravity	Change
🔴 High	Hard-guard vertical vs. horizontal code ownership and move scene-agnostic 3D utilities out of the app layer.
🟠 Medium	Separate AWS / Tencent IaC roots; add API gateway skeleton.
🟢 Nice	Asset pipeline pulls heavy binaries at build; enforce consistent package scope; shader & test linting polish.

The current layout is solid — these small structural nudges will save churn when the team (and binary asset set) grows.
