## What is Orb (name of our agentic product) about?

Imagine a sphere--user's self is on the inside and the user's world on the outside, divided by a 3 step cycle: know-->act-->show. This model represents the iterative process of personal growth:

1. Know yourself: understand your needs, wants, desires and dreams
2. Do something for yourself, by yourself
3. Show yourself who you are and what you are capable of, then revisit your knowledge of yourself (1)
4. Learn about the world around you, what you care the most about the world, what you like about it and what you want to change about it how you relate to the world 
5. Do something for the world around you, make it better and closer to your ideal, maybe by doing what successfully do for yourself to solve your own pain points but for more people like you
6. Show the world who you are and tell others what you can do for them and feed into understanding of your position in the world (4)

Our product's goals is to help users define their identity, find their voice, gain creative agency and build connection with their inner self and the outside world. It provides this scaffolding to get users into this positive reinforcement cycle until doing this on their own becomes second nature. Even then, it would still be helpful to leverage a powerful AI as your personal think tank, coaching team, strategy adviser and private office (think of the president's office) and above all a safe haven and home base where user has access and control to his/her core identity all encoded into a powerful knowledge graph, structured to best bring out meaning in life.

It solves several pain points: for some, especially AI power users, these are already hurting and inconveniencing them; for other, this may soon become pain points. And the pain point is that their data is scattered across too many products, platforms and social media. These data has huge value to the users themselves because even the questions they ask and concerns they raise reveal what they care or are curious about, how they think and react. But these data is largely siloed and processed and analyzed by the owner of the products for bettering their product but not for the purpose of helping the users understand themselves better, get meaning from their past and make more informed decisions based on facts from their own life's learnings. There is a lot of missed opportunities, not to mention that it poses a privacy risk for users if they have no control over their own data, which when consolidated can construct their personal identity and their world model.

Some products are being optimized to keep user engaged, attached and addicted even, trying to please user with biased answers without independent judgment, values or moral standards. Some products are trying hard to carry the conversation, make it almost believable that they know the users by pretending (using salesperson techniques without a genuine concern). Some products are well intentioned but lacking the right infrastructure, not using the right memory database (relying solely on large context and RAG for example). Some are using advanced memory technique such as GraphRAG but lacking the proper design to look for diamond in the rough and organize memory for the specific purpose of driving continuous user-led personal transformation. 

Our product doesn't offer painkiller or sugar coated empty praises. It doesn't replace a lover or a human friend. It tries to know you, the world you are, in order to support you as you embark on the journey to leverage all the AI capability that the world has to offer, to find out (in an more efficient way than ever) who you are, how you related to the world, who you want to become, what you can bring to the world and while doing so help you form your personal narrative through your own voice, ground your action and decisions in your own life story and encourage you to share your story with the world to ultimately build your own legacy. Have an identity, have a voice, make some impact, find your place, build a legacy.

You can say it is AI companion, life coach, strategy adviser, content manager, productivity assistant, ghost writer for celebrity / autobiographer, cheerleader, mentor, one's manifested inner voice. It is not that agent who does the shopping for you (there are specialized agents who do that which our agent can work with though).

Orb is like a being in the space, it watches over you from the space and understands what you are going through and what's on your mind in the worldy day-to-day, it also sees the universe (both physical and the metapherical universe of oen's dimensional being) and translates your worldly experience into "stars" embedded into your "universe", connected in a knowledge graph. Because Orb can see the big picture (in two senses, one is that it sees you and also has access to humankind collective experience as part of LLM model's general knowledge, the other sense is that it can effortlessly see the interconnectedness of your daily experience and thoughts over long stretches of time, benefiting from a long term memory based on GraphRag, it can extract meaning and life themes and journeys in unexpected ways)

## Who might need this product: 
- Those with a lot of interests, pursuits, skills, life experiences but they all seem disconnected and it's hard for them to find their true calling 
- Those with a lot of ideas but slow to action 
- Those with great thinking and are results driven but don't know how to communicate what they have done
- Those who communicate a ton about what they have done but people don't know who they are as person so they don't get to form meainingful relationship, viewed as doers but not leaders
- Those who have a strong presence and network but the personal IP or branding is not true to who are really are
- Those who have a very clear mid-long term goal or milestone that require them to address these deeply provoking questions such as high school students applying to college, professionals switching career, people building a family
- Those who know what to do but need some structure and discipline (scaffolding)
- Those who are already trying to do this with various products (some focusing on AI chats, others on productivity, another as AI companion) but want to have one home base app that actually has full transparency on the personal graph database

## User experience

Need to build trust, get the users to think, reflect, share, act, react, create, share, broadcast
Make the user feel
- Understood, accepted, inspired, healed
- Pleasantly surprised, often amazed and sometimes humbled
- Transported yet grounded in facts
- Confident and ambitious
- Connected yet independent
- In control and in the flow and flexible
- Seen and recognized

## Points of usage
- Inital onboarding / sign up: the goal is to orient the user on the app in a cinematic journey with functional intro embedded unobtrusively. The point is to set up the vibe, build trust and get user excited about using it. Specific usage instruction is naturally occurring as user starts to use the tool, but not jammed at the onboarding stage. This is also important branding moment and set up first impression
- Initial trial use: this is the important experience that gets user to become paid user. [help me think through how to build this out, what is free, to what extent, for how long or how much usage]
- Wake up / set the intention for the day: Orb can share a dream it has about the user as it consolidates the memorygraph and finds new connections and themes, this can be serious new insights with a little fun absurdity, since it's a dream. User can react to it and or start a conversation
- Get things done / focus: Orb is more like a coach or a chief of staff, available to run down the priorities for the day and keep a timer for each activity if needed. More importantly, Orb can remind the user how each small task (as short as 15 min of hyper concentration) help advance on specific goals which all link to themes that the user cares about (all is traceable in the graph view). Orb itself also get things done for user. In its writer capacity, Orb can easily write content such as essays, blog posts, draft email. 
- Looking for ideas and inspirations / brainstorming / bounce ideas off: 
- Take a break / recharge: this is about how people like to pick up their phone when they are stuck or bored. We want to train the user to make use of that fragmented time to talk to Orb or push curated content to user for them to make productive use of that time which effortlessly check things off of their to-do list. Say people could say they want to study Japanese for 10 minutes a day. 
- Reflect / debrief: this can be a daily routine or triggered by content of a chat 
- First - aide moment: in a moment of stress or distress, user might resort to a chat (my guess based on user habit but I'm open to other suggestions). Orb can obviously carry conversation like any other agent, it also remembers the situation, record into graph and also in the back of its mind compile situations that it remembers the user going through similar challenges. Orb strings these together and let the user see these facts and in parallel compile real stories from real people going through moments like this -- the lesson is not about "hey if these other great people can do it, you can do it too" but rather "I have seen you growing in all these dimensions over time and you share the same qualities that these great people had when they faced similar challenges". These are facts for the user to take or leave, not preaching or comforting language to temporarily soften the blow. 
- Celebration: to encourage user to update Orb on large or small wins, Orb should have a way of celebrating these moments with the user. As small as having successfully completely x tasks the user planned in the morning for the day, or over the course of 18 months of hard work, finished first marathon, or getting into a dream school, or overcame fear in public speaking by taking certain action. Orb is observant about any intention-planning-action loop. The celebration is not hinged on external validation (such as winning certain awards). Orb should also proactively follow up on how things are going if it notices there are open loops that can be easily closed with a small action.
- On-the-go / recording fleeting thought / quick question: quick access is the key (maybe through short cut button), for user to leave a message, assign a task, record a fleeting thought. Orb will clarify later on when user opens the app
- Wind down / self care routine / check out for the day: this could be a chat about what the plans are for tomorrow, what went well today, what lessons have been learned and leave a question for Orb to figure out while you are in sleep (so that the user doesn't have to worry about it) and Orb will compile a sound track (ASMR type) that's customized for the user for the user to listen to

## Sample interfaces [need your help to reimagine]
- Home / dashboard view: it should draw user attention to content, feature, activity that user might need the most given the broader context and time of day (as explained in the previous section) 
- traditional chat interface. 
- Knowledge graph observatory, a place where user can look at, admire, explroe, edit the knowledge graph beautifully visualized in custom d3.js that represents their life's fabric. They should be able to add, edit, remove entity nodes and relationship edges and use natural language to ask Orb questions which Orb (potentially with help from another specialized agetn) will translate into cypher script to extract relevant nodes and edges and weave into an answer. User should also be able to craft artifacts (e.g., essay, blog posts, generate image, write letter, bedtime stories, meditation guide by dragging and dropping entities)
- Library, a place where user stores custom artifacts created from the app usage. This includes those proactively created by Orb as morning greetings, as well as user created content (journal entries, uploaded image, voice recording, etc.) Sometimes, user really likes a conversation with Orb and can easily click a button "save to library", which then allows Orb to summarize the back and forth conversation into a succinct summary. Each artifact can be edited and even regenerated based on user direction
- [anything else?]

## How do user navigate across these interfaces
- The navigation should be seamless and part of the immersive experience. See example of the transition from home or chat to graph observatory: "A cinematic aerial journey unfolds, beginning above soft snowy mountain peaks during golden hour. The camera floats gently forward, as if weightless, gliding just above the ridgelines. The sky is a warm gradient of apricot, blush, and gold. Clouds glow from within—peachy and translucent, as if lit by memory.

As the camera ascends, it pierces these clouds. The light gradually cools: gold fades into soft lavender and then into deep periwinkle. The air thins. Wisps of mist begin to part.

Subtle stars begin to emerge—delicate, almost imperceptible at first—blinking faintly in the upper atmosphere. The sky deepens in color: indigo, then deep sapphire.

Without a break in motion, the camera transcends into a vast, quiet interstellar realm. There is no ship, no figure—just space unfolding. Nebulas bloom in distant silence. A few constellations shimmer faintly, like the sky is remembering itself.

The atmosphere, pacing, and color palette should evoke the meditative, weightless beauty of Arvo Pärt’s “Spiegel im Spiegel.” The transition should feel natural and continuous, like breath: from golden earth to cosmic vastness, through stillness and wonder.

## Data input
- In-app interactions (chat, file upload, creation, reaction and edits to artifacts)
- User usage pattern
- Sign-in basic information
- Browser plugin to intercept information as user uses 3rd party website or AI apps
- Information requested through MCP or A2A from 3rd party AI tools (e.g., as user chats with Claude, information relevant for the user's personal knowledge graph will be transmitted back to our database, or something like that)
- Public domain knowledge: such as user's social media account (with user permission)
- User's local or cloud based file storage (e.g., journal folder, paper folder)

## Orb's image and personality
Appearance: amorphous orb that changes its state across solid (like a cyrstal ball), liquid (like water floating in space), gas (cloud like)

It doesn't have facial features like humans do

It has two hands, one is human shaped but colorless, like "invisible hand", foggy glass semi-see through like it's made of acrylic; the other hand is futuristic mechanic robotic hand, highly reflective, mercury texture. There is no visible arm but the hands are positioned naturally from the orb (as the body) saving the space for where the arm would belong. We don't want to illustrate the arm to create this minimalist visual experience 

Orb moves, glows, hovers and breathes. it expresses with its hand motions and the shape, state, texture, transparency of its body.

Its shape can expand, contract, morph slightly, breath subtly

It can change states

transparency can change from crystal clear to foggy, cloudy

texture can be smooth or fuzzy

reflects or tinted by the surrounding background color
