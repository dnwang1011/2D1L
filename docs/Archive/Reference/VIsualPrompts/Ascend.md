🎬 Sora Prompt — “Ascend”

A cinematic aerial journey unfolds, beginning above soft snowy mountain peaks during golden hour. The camera floats gently forward, as if weightless, gliding just above the ridgelines. The sky is a warm gradient of apricot, blush, and gold. Clouds glow from within—peachy and translucent, as if lit by memory.

As the camera ascends, it pierces these clouds. The light gradually cools: gold fades into soft lavender and then into deep periwinkle. The air thins. Wisps of mist begin to part.

Subtle stars begin to emerge—delicate, almost imperceptible at first—blinking faintly in the upper atmosphere. The sky deepens in color: indigo, then deep sapphire.

Without a break in motion, the camera transcends into a vast, quiet interstellar realm. There is no ship, no figure—just space unfolding. Nebulas bloom in distant silence. A few constellations shimmer faintly, like the sky is remembering itself.

The atmosphere, pacing, and color palette should evoke the meditative, weightless beauty of Arvo Pärt’s “Spiegel im Spiegel.” The transition should feel natural and continuous, like breath: from golden earth to cosmic vastness, through stillness and wonder.
