Parallel Workstream Opportunities:
Based on these dependencies, here are potential parallel workstreams:
Workstream 1: Core Backend & Event System (Sprints 1-2)
Focus: growth_events schema, Event Store, Event Processors, mu_view, Ingestion Worker.
Workstream 2: API Development (From Sprint 1.5 onwards)
Focus: apps/backend-api, implementing endpoints as needed by frontend and other services.
Workstream 3: Frontend UI - Canvas & Scenes (Sprints 2-3, 5.1)
Focus: canvas-core, CloudScene, GraphScene, Scene Transitions.
Workstream 4: Frontend UI - Orb & Modals (Sprints 2-5)
Focus: OrbStateManager, OrbResolver, OrbVisualizer, ChatModal, CardGalleryModal, DashboardModal, Orb Animations.
Workstream 5: Dialogue Agent Evolution (Sprint 4)
Focus: Refactoring Dialogue Agent for V7.
Workstream 6: Deployment, Optimization, Documentation, Mobile Web (Sprint 6)
Cross-cutting concerns towards the end of the project.
Key Coordination Points:
API Contracts: Define and agree upon API request/response formats early between frontend and backend teams/tasks.
Event Definitions: The growth_events schema is central; services emitting and consuming these events must align.
Shared Types: The packages/shared-types package must be kept up-to-date and used consistently.
OrbSystemPrompt.md: Critical for Dialogue Agent and Orb behavior consistency.
v7TechSpec.md, v7UIUXDesign.md, V7DataSchemaDesign.md, V7MonoRepoDesign.md: Serve as the guiding documents for all workstreams.
This detailed breakdown of dependencies should provide a much clearer path for parallel execution and help avoid "shooting ourselves in the foot." I recommend keeping this dependency list in mind as we proceed.
Does this address your concerns about potential disconnects and provide a good overview of interdependencies for multitasking?
