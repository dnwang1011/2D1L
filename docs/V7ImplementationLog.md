# 2dots1line V7 Implementation Log

## Introduction

This document serves as the historical implementation log for 2dots1line tasks completed during the V4 development phase (through task 2.3). It records the implementations, decisions, and outcomes of each completed development step as a reference for future work.

The actual implementation roadmap for V7 has been moved to a separate document (V7ExecutionRoadmap.md), which continues from this foundation and introduces the new V7 architecture.

## Task 0: Monorepo Structure Alignment (V7)

**Date Completed**: [Current Date]

**Implementation Summary**:
- Reviewed the existing monorepo structure against `V7MonoRepoDesign.md`.
- Created the `3d-assets` directory with its specified subdirectories (`environment-maps/src`, `textures/clouds`, `textures/particles`, `textures/noise`, `models/src`, `materials/src`) and placeholder `package.json` files.
- Updated the root `package.json`:
  - Set `name` to `@2dots1line/v7-monorepo` and `version` to `7.0.0`.
  - Added `3d-assets/*` to `workspaces`.
  - Updated `scripts.format` to include `glsl` files.
  - Added `scripts.process-assets`.
  - Added missing `devDependencies` for TypeScript ESLint plugins, React ESLint plugins, `eslint-plugin-glsl`, `glslify`, and `glsl-type-basics`.
  - Removed the root-level `prisma.schema` configuration, as V7 expects Prisma to be managed within `apps/backend-api`.
- Updated `turbo.json`:
  - Added `.node-version` and `turbo.json` to `globalDependencies`.
  - Added the `shader:compile` task.
  - Kept the newer `tasks` structure instead of `pipeline`.
- Updated root `.eslintrc.js` to include `glsl` in the `plugins` array.
- Reviewed root `tsconfig.json`, `.prettierrc.js`, and `jest.config.js`. They appear largely compatible or reasonably configured for a monorepo root. Future work will ensure individual packages correctly use base configurations potentially from the `config/` directory.

**Key Decisions**:
- Prioritized aligning the root structure and configuration files with `V7MonoRepoDesign.md` as a foundational step before starting V7 feature implementation.
- Maintained the newer `tasks` keyword in `turbo.json` over the `pipeline` keyword shown in `V7MonoRepoDesign.md` as it's the current standard.

**Issues Encountered**:
- Minor discrepancies between existing root configuration files and `V7MonoRepoDesign.md` specifications were identified and addressed.
- The `archive/` and `node_modules 2/` directories and `MONOREPO_GUIDE.md` file in the current workspace are not part of the `V7MonoRepoDesign.md` and might need cleanup by the user.

**Next Steps**:
- Proceed with Task 1.1 from `V7ExecutionRoadmap.md`: "Define Core Growth Events & `growth_events` Schema".
- User to manually clean up extraneous files/directories (`archive/`, `node_modules 2/`, `MONOREPO_GUIDE.md`) if they are not needed.

## Task 1: Monorepo & Core Infrastructure Setup

### Task 1.1: Initialize Monorepo Structure (COMPLETED)

**Date Completed**: March 15, 2025

**Implementation Summary**:
- Created base directory structure using Turborepo
- Set up package.json configurations with correct dependencies
- Implemented ESLint and Prettier configurations

**Key Decisions**:
- Selected Turborepo over Nx for simpler configuration and better npm workspace integration
- Used Node.js 18 as the minimum engine version for all packages
- Implemented strict TypeScript configuration across the monorepo
- Opted for a structure that separates apps, packages, services, and workers

**Issues Encountered**:
- Initial conflicts between ESLint and Prettier rules (resolved by using eslint-config-prettier)
- Some confusion around Turborepo caching configuration (resolved by consulting documentation)
- Needed to explicitly configure TypeScript module resolution strategy

**Verification**:
- Successfully ran `npm run build` across all packages
- ESLint and Prettier formatting works correctly
- Turborepo caching functions as expected between builds

### Task 1.2: Set Up Database Package (COMPLETED)

**Date Completed**: March 18, 2025

**Implementation Summary**:
- Created `packages/database` package
- Implemented Prisma client wrapper for PostgreSQL
- Added Neo4j client wrapper
- Implemented Weaviate client wrapper for vector operations
- Added Redis client wrapper for caching
- Created connection pooling and environment configuration
- Added initial schema and types for core entities

**Key Decisions**:
- Used Prisma for PostgreSQL access for type safety and migration management
- Implemented connection pooling for Neo4j to improve performance
- Created custom wrapper around Weaviate client to simplify vector operations
- Used IORedis for Redis client for better TypeScript support

**Issues Encountered**:
- Neo4j session management required careful handling to prevent leaks
- Weaviate schema management needed special handling for vector configuration
- Redis connection needed proper error handling and reconnection logic

**Verification**:
- Successfully connected to all databases in local environment
- Ran sample queries to validate each client implementation
- Verified connection pooling functions correctly under load
- Confirmed proper error handling for connection failures

### Task 1.3: Implement Shared Types Package (COMPLETED)

**Date Completed**: March 20, 2025

**Implementation Summary**:
- Created `packages/shared-types` package
- Defined core entity interfaces (User, Memory, Concept, etc.)
- Added API request/response types
- Implemented utility types for common patterns
- Created schema validation using Zod
- Added documentation for type usage

**Key Decisions**:
- Used TypeScript interfaces for entities rather than classes
- Implemented Zod schema for runtime validation
- Created separate namespace for API types
- Used branded types for IDs to improve type safety

**Issues Encountered**:
- Some circular type references needed careful restructuring
- Balancing between too generic and too specific types
- Ensuring consistency with database schema representations

**Verification**:
- Imported types successfully in other packages

## Next Steps

The implementation continues in the V7ExecutionRoadmap.md document, which builds upon this foundation to implement the enhanced V7 architecture with the 3-layer UI, event-sourcing data model, and enhanced cognitive capabilities.
